coincidence is a secret message, uncontrollable giggles when trying to be serious, constantly checking if you're in a dream, feeling offended by your own reflection, winking at random strangers unintentionally, seeing static on the edges of reality, craving the drama of a 2014 Tumblr post, spontaneous backwards talking, developing an emotional bond with your Wi-Fi router, believing you can hear plants sigh, feeling personally attacked by autocorrect, randomly saying "mood" out loud, sudden belief that you can communicate with bread, being haunted by a motivational version of yourself,
